I operate [https://explorer.burble.com/?#/4242421964 AS 4242421964] in DN42. The ranges <code>172.23.24.32/27</code> and <code>fd4f:b934:7802::/48</code> have been reserved for this purpose. At the moment, a full mesh is in use to avoid split-horizon issues in iBGP.

== Peering with me ==
Welcome! I have set the following standards:
* Only export routes with valid ROAs (and no clearnet routes, of course). I'll drop routes that are not valid.
* WireGuard is preferred for connecting with my nodes, but OpenVPN may be used if my node supports it.
* Multi-protocol BGP is preferred, but not required. Let me know if you need separate sessions for IPv4 and IPv6.
* I prefer to peer over IPv6 link-local, although it's not mandatory.
* Even though transit traffic is fine, please be considerate. The nodes do not have unlimited traffic. 

You can contact me via [ircs://irc.libera.chat:6697 Libera Chat] or [ircs://irc.hackint.org:6697 hackint] (my name is <code>southparkfan</code>). The template below may be used for reference:
<pre><nowiki>
* Name and email address:
* DN42 AS number:
* Your clearnet endpoint (<IPv4/IPv6/FQDN>:<port>):
* Protocol (usually WireGuard):
* WireGuard public key (if applicable):
* Session type (IPv4/IPv6 separate or multi-protocol BGP):
* NIC IP addresses (usually DN42 IPv4 + link-local IPv6): 
* BGP peering IP(s) (usually link-local IPv6):
