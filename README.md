# AS 4242421964 / SPF-NET
I operate [AS 4242421964](https://explorer.burble.com/?#/4242421964) in DN42. The ranges `172.23.24.32/27` and `fd4f:b934:7802::/48` have been reserved for this purpose. At the moment, a full mesh is in use to avoid split-horizon issues in iBGP.

## Peering with me
Welcome! I have set the following standards:
- Only export routes with valid ROAs (and no clearnet routes, of course). I'll drop routes that are not valid.
- WireGuard is preferred for connecting with my nodes, but OpenVPN may be used if my node supports it.
- Multi-protocol BGP is preferred, but not required. Let me know if you need separate sessions for IPv4 and IPv6.
- I prefer to peer over IPv6 link-local, although it's not mandatory.
- Even though transit traffic is fine, please be considerate. The nodes do not have unlimited traffic. 

You can contact me via [hackint](ircs://irc.hackint.org:6697) (my name is `southparkfan`). The template below may be used for reference:
```
* Name/email:
* DN42 AS number:
* Clearnet endpoint (<IPv4/IPv6/FQDN>:<port>):
* Protocol (OpenVPN/WireGuard):
* WireGuard public key (if applicable):
* Session type (IPv4/IPv6 separate or multi-protocol BGP):
* BGP endpoint IP(s) (e.g. link-local IPv6):
```
